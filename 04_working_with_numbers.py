# ABOUT:
# This code uses a variable to store an integer value
# then various mathematical functions are tested in print command

# importing all the objects from the math class
from math import *

# variable defines and assigned value
my_num = 5
print(my_num)

# the new value over rights the old value of the variable
my_num = -5
print(my_num)

# various print commands to print out integer values
print(2)
print(2.123456789)
print(-123444.23553)

# performing mathematical functions in the print command
print(3+2.5)
print(3*(4+5))

# print the absolute value of the variable
print(abs(my_num))

# floor - rounds the floating number to the lower number
print(floor(3.7))

# ceil - rounds the floating number to the higher number
print(ceil(3.2))
